<h1>VERDICT</h1>
<p>docs and tutorials: Flask - in particular "The Flask Mega Tutorial"</p>
<p>whipuptitude: Shiny - and I don't even really know R</p>
<p>cherries on the cake: Mojolicious because of surrounding helpers/functions, some people say "async"</p>
<p>cool feature: Seaside - the client server editing is just the thing!</p>
<p>nice community: Dancer - thanks to the lovely vegan code princess :)</p>
<p>personal taste: Web::Machine - because I have no idea. Just appeals to me</p>
<p>shortcut: CouchDB - why have a web framework in between at all? ;)</p>
