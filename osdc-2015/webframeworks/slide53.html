<h1>famous last words</h1>
<h3>in the end, the "cool" stuff is worthless</h3>
<p>... if it's buggy or broken,</p>
<p>... not really used in the wild,</p>
<p>... has no docs,</p>
<p>... no community to speak of,</p>
<p>... is too alien,</p>
<p>... or doesn't play well with others</p>
<p>... remember the Reddit rewrite from Lisp to Python? ENVIRONMENT!</p>
<h3>in that regard, "popular" and "worse" IS better.</h3>
