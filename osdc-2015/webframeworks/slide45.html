<h1>caveats:</h1>
<p>extremely alien if you come from the "regular" kinds of frameworks</p>
<p>you better REALLY know OO</p>
<p>so tightly intergrated to Smalltalk images - you can't even easily version it
ghetto language problem (they do everything EVERYTHING their own way. Ok, they
invented most ways, but..)</p>
<p>so tightly integrated and so much magic that .. good luck if something doesn't
work</p>
<p>no folklore, no examples in the wild to take a look at</p>
