"pgTAP is a unit testing framework for PostgreSQL written in PL/pgSQL and
PL/SQL. It includes a comprehensive collection of TAP-emitting assertion
functions, as well as the ability to integrate with other TAP-emitting test
frameworks. It can also be used in the xUnit testing style."

Jenkins/BuildBot/YouNameIt CD/CI thing
